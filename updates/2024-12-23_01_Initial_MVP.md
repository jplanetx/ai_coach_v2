Assistant: Claude-3.5-Sonnet (December 2024)

## Accomplished Tasks

### 1. Backend Implementation
- Created clean backend structure using FastAPI
- Implemented proper Notion integration with error handling
- Added task filtering to exclude completed/archived tasks
- Set up robust error logging
- Created health check endpoint
- Implemented async Notion client with proper error handling
- Added safe property extraction for Notion data

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- Set up React frontend with TypeScript
- Implemented Eisenhower Matrix visualization
- Added task categorization based on importance/urgency
- Implemented real-time task updates
- Added loading states and error handling
- Created proper type definitions

### 3. Core Features Working
- Fetching tasks from Notion database
- Displaying tasks in Eisenhower Matrix
- Filtering out completed/archived tasks
- Real-time task updates
- Error handling and recovery
- Status display and task count

### 4. Technical Setup
- Environment configuration with .env files
- TypeScript type definitions
- CORS configuration
- API route structure
- Notion client configuration
- OpenAI integration preparation

## Current Status
- Basic MVP is operational
- Can view tasks in Eisenhower Matrix
- Successfully fetching from Notion
- Backend API is stable
- Frontend is rendering correctly

## Next Steps Identified
1. Add drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between quadrants
2. Implement AI insights for task properties
3. Add task creation capability
4. Implement voice commands
5. Add task property editing
6. Enhance error reporting
7. Add loading state refinements
8. Implement proper WebSocket for real-time updates

## Technical Notes
- Backend: Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Database: Notion API
- AI: OpenAI API (prepared for integration)

## Dependencies
### Backend
- FastAPI
- Notion Client
- OpenAI
- Pydantic Settings

### Frontend
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Notion API Client

## Configuration
Environment variables required:
- NOTION_API_KEY
- NOTION_TASKS_DATABASE_ID
- NOTION_AREAS_DATABASE_ID
- NOTION_PROJECTS_DATABASE_ID
- OPENAI_API_KEY

## Known Issues
- Semi-transparent overlay during updates (low priority)
- Loading state refinements needed
- WebSocket implementation pending

## Notes for Next Developer
1. The project is structured for modularity and easy expansion
2. Core Notion integration is solid but could be enhanced
3. AI features are prepared but not fully implemented
4. Focus has been on stability and error handling
5. Code is ready for adding real-time features
