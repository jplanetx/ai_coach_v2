# Update Creation Prompt

You are taking over development of the AI Coach project. Before proceeding with any new development, please create a comprehensive update of your work. This update will help maintain continuity between different AI assistants working on the project.

## Instructions

1. Read the previous updates in the /updates directory chronologically
2. Review all code changes in your session
3. Create a new update file following these naming conventions:
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD_XX_Brief_Description.md
   - XX = Sequential number for that day (01, 02, etc.)
   - Example: 2024-12-23_02_Added_Voice_Commands.md

4. Use the UPDATE_TEMPLATE.md as your base structure
5. Fill in all sections with current, accurate information
6. Include:
   - Exact timestamps (EST)
   - Your model/version information
   - All accomplished tasks
   - Current project state
   - Next steps
   - Any issues or blockers

## Critical Information to Include

1. Document all:
   - API changes
   - Database changes
   - New dependencies
   - Configuration changes
   - Environment variable changes

2. Highlight:
   - Breaking changes
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications
   - Technical debt created
   - Known bugs or limitations

3. Provide:
   - Context for decisions made
   - Rationale for architectural choices
   - Suggestions for next steps
   - Areas needing attention

## Best Practices

1. Be specific and detailed
2. Use clear, technical language
3. Include enough context for the next AI to understand your changes
4. Link to relevant documentation or code files
5. Highlight any assumptions made
6. Note any temporary solutions or workarounds

## After Creating Update

1. Place the update file in the /updates directory
2. Ensure all code changes are documented
3. Verify all configuration changes are noted
4. Include any relevant metrics or statistics

Remember: Your update serves as the primary handoff document for the next AI assistant. Make it as comprehensive and clear as possible.
